Zero Knowledge Proofs and how they can be implemented in Quorum

This is a SNARK implementation using libsnark for the following:

``ZkPoK{ (R1, R2, R3): Hi = sha256(Ri) and R3 = R1 + R2 }``

Read: given `H1`, `H2`, `H3`, prove you know `R1`, `R2`, `R3` such that `R1` is the preimage of `H1`, `R2` is the preimage of `H2`, `R3` is the preimage of `H3`, and `R3` is `R1 + R2`.

This is an implementation and benchmark of the "Receive" zk-SNARK in the Confidential Transaction scheme from this article: <https://media.consensys.net/introduction-to-zksnarks-with-examples-3283b554fc3b>.

Code based on <https://github.com/ebfull/lightning_circuit>.

## howto

### Required packages

* On Ubuntu 16.04 LTS:

        `$ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake git libgmp3-dev libprocps4-dev python-markdown libboost-all-dev libssl-dev`

* On Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:

        `$ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake git libgmp3-dev libprocps3-dev python-markdown libboost-all-dev libssl-dev`

### Installation

`./get-libsnark && make`

`npm install`

### Running  
`node index.js startBalance=10000`

First select  
1. Single payment in and single payment out
2. Multiple payments in and multiple payments out

Follow the prompts.  

1. Generate a key pair
2. Generate a proof (single or multiple)
4. Verify proof
0. Quit

#### Generate a new key pair  
This creates a new proving key and verification key from the circuit.  They are saved to the files:  
* `provingKey-single` or `provingKey-multi`
* `verificationKey-single` or `verificationKey-multi`

#### Generate a payment proof  
This generates a proof using the proving key as well as the following values:

* `start balance`
* `incoming payment/s`
* `outgoing payment/s`
* `end balance` (start balance + incoming - outgoing)

The proof is:  
* `start balance` + `incoming payments` = `end balance` + `outgoing payments`

#### Verify payment proof  
Verifies the above proofs
